# Slime Map

---

This mod adds a new type of map showing nearby slime chunks. It works like a normal map, you can put it on an item frame and use it in a cartography table.

## Config

The config file is directly in the `config` folder, named `slimemap.json`.
At the moment, the only thing you can configure is if the showed slime chunks completely replace the blocks below or not, the option is called coverBlocks, put `0` if you want below blocks to appear and `1` if you don't want them to appear


# Suggestion

If you want some **more functionalities to the locate command** as well as **slime chunk command finder**, check out my other mod [Advanced Locate](https://modrinth.com/mod/advancedlocate).
